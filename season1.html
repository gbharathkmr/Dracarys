        <h1 class="h0">The rise of Daenerys Targaryen begins</h1>
        <img src="images/gallery/season1 (1).jpg" alt="">
        <p>Originally from Valyria on the continent of Essos, House Targaryen conquered the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and ruled for 300 years through the use of dragons. Its coat of arms is a red three-headed dragon on black, and its motto is “Fire and Blood.” The rule of the Targaryens ended when Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark led a rebellion to depose King Aerys, during which the king was slain by Jaime Lannister. Afterward, Robert took the Iron Throne, and Aerys’s surviving two children (Daenerys and Viserys) were exiled to Essos.</p>

        <img src="images/gallery/season1 (2).jpg" alt="">
        <p>On the continent of Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen sells his younger sister, Daenerys, into marriage to the Dothraki tribal leader, Khal Drogo, in return for the service of Drogo’s army. Viserys plans to use the army to invade Westeros and win back the Iron Throne for House Targaryen. At the wedding, Daenerys receives three priceless dragon eggs that are thought to have turned to stone. Daenerys, now called “Khaleesi,” begins to fall in love with Drogo and find the strength to stand up to Viserys, who continues to view her as a simple tool to get the power he desires.</p>
        <img src="images/gallery/season1 (3).jpg" alt="">
        <p>Daenerys learns that she is pregnant with Drogo’s child and begins to find her place and her power within the tribe, which gives her even more strength to stand up to Viserys’s abuses. News of Daenerys’s pregnancy reaches King’s Landing, and King Robert orders Ned to send assassins to eliminate Daenerys, her unborn child (who could have claim to the Iron Throne), and Viserys. Ned refuses to commit this dishonorable act and resigns as Hand of the King.</p>
        <img src="images/gallery/gallery11 (6).jpg" alt="">
        <p> Daenerys’s son is stillborn. Drogo lies comatose and is believed never to recover, so the rest of the tribe decides to move on, leaving Daenerys and a few of her loyal followers behind. One night, consumed by grief and without hope, Daenerys releases Drogo by smothering him with a pillow. Later, Daenerys and her followers construct a funeral pyre for Drogo. Daenerys orders her dragon eggs placed onto the pyre and lights the pyre. Then Daenerys walks into the flames. In the morning, Daenerys sits, completely unharmed, among the smoldering embers of the pyre, with three baby dragons clinging to her. Her followers swear their loyalty to her as queen and hail her as the Mother of Dragons.</p>
